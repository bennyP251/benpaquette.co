                        <p>In life, I have had so many opportunities to make a decision that would change some part of my life. Deciding on a major and college when I was 17 years old. Moving 1300 miles away from where I spent the first 22 years of my life to a town I didn't know a single person. Taking a job that would put me in a long distance relationship and once again alone in a new state. In February of 2024, I had enough of this constant change in my life. I wanted something permanent, something I could grow, thrive, and dedicate my time to. Working within the field of Information Technology allowed me to do all of those things along with the ability to settle down, or even go somewhere else if life choices needed me too. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>On May 12th, 2024 I gave the Principal Investigator I was working under a two months notice on my departure from my current position. For the past year I had been living in New Orleans where I was working at LSU - Health Science Center within the Physical Therapy Department. Growing up in Southern New Hampshire my whole life, I thought moving to South Georgia was a big culture shock but I guess I never lived in New Orleans. Everything about New Orleans was unique and different from back home. The food, the community, the culture, the parades, THE PARADES. This was one of the most unique places I have ever lived in my whole life and everyone that visited me said the same thing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Before giving my supervisor my notice of leave, I had been spending the past 2 months working on my first certification exam, CompTIA A+ 1101. This certification was very interesting as it covered such a large amount of material in so many different sectors. Through the hours and hours of blog posts, YouTube videos, and ChatGPT prompts the A+ was a good starting certification for getting your foot in the door within IT. I would soon learn this is super dependent on HR, the job itself, and many other factors. I don't regret my time learning and going through online courses and practice exams for this certification. On July 27th, I left New Orleans and drove all the way to Athens, Georgia with no job but one interview lined up.</p>
